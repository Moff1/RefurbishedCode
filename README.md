# A Spotify Story...

## Description

Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turn upside down- Just kidding. My life is great; one could even say sensational. But one of things that makes my life so sensational is the music I listen to. 
Every knows that Spotify Wrapped comes out once a year, and we all obesses about what other people were listening to. However I decided to complete a deep dive on my own music tastes, and some of the things I found out about my music tastes were fascinating to say the least.
